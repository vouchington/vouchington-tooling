# Pull-request description

Read applicable `AGENTS.md` and their declared adapter alias, otherwise
`.agents/skills/pr-description/SKILL.md` from the repository root if present.
Local policy overrides these defaults; do not reload an already-read adapter or canonical skill.

Use before opening or updating a pull request, after diagnosing a CI failure, or at handoff. Read local
`AGENTS.md`, pull-request template, and issue-linking policy first.

Keep the description understandable without the conversation. Its short visible core explains:

- **Summary:** what changed, why, and the concrete before/after behavior. For a fix, explain its
  root cause as well as the symptom. A reader should understand the outcome before implementation
  details.
- **Impact:** who or what is affected and how their behavior changes. Name the actual audience,
  such as end users, staff, API clients, operators, or contributors. Keep material risks and
  limitations visible. For internal work, describe the affected development or operational flow.

Add detail only where the change warrants it:

- For cost changes, state the direction and scope. Label figures as measured or estimated, name the
  workload and assumptions, and link evidence. Say unmeasured when no defensible figure exists;
  do not invent savings or claim a neutral cost without evidence. Follow the consumer's privacy
  policy before reporting actual spending, and use approved aggregated or redacted evidence.
- For database changes, inventory added, removed, and changed tables, columns, constraints, and
  indexes. Explain the relationships and conformance to the consumer's schema rules, including
  producer/consumer changes and any justified exceptions. Link the policy and concrete evidence.
- For API, workflow, or independently deployed changes, explain the affected contract, lifecycle,
  or operational safety. Follow the consumer's compatibility and deployment policy.
- Use a before/after table or meaningful Mermaid diagram when it makes behavior, relationships,
  workflow topology, or lifecycle easier to understand. Prose is sufficient for a simple change.

Put long comparisons, inventories, diagrams, calculations, and failure evidence in collapsed
`<details>` sections. Keep the short conclusions and material risks outside them. Keep the
consumer's required visible core headings outside disclosure containers. Put opening/closing tags
on separate lines, with a blank line after `</summary>` and before `</details>` so Markdown renders.
Read [description examples](references/examples.md) when choosing a comparison, diagram, or failure
record.

Do not fill the description with routine local successful-test lists. This is a reporting rule,
not permission to skip checks: execute required validation and retain its revision, exact scope,
result, and any omission reason in the work's evidence record.

Include **Harness gaps** only after CI diagnosis establishes an omitted local verification or a
proven local/CI mismatch. Link the first failing run/job and its exact head revision, compare the actual local and
CI scope, explain the omission or difference, and record the durable correction or authorized
linked follow-up. Distinguish an omitted check from one that passed locally. Unknown coverage is
not evidence of a miss; classify genuine CI-only or external infrastructure failures separately.
Retain confirmed gap records after CI turns green. Diagnose the failure through the repository's
CI investigation workflow; a failed status alone does not establish a gap.

Use the repository's approved PR tooling and preserve sections managed by its review automation
verbatim. Close only issues fully resolved and explain non-closing issue links. Apply this guidance
to descriptions being created or updated, not a bulk rewrite of historical pull requests.

Consumer wrapper owns: required headings, source-issue rule, merge policy, repository command, and
hosted review system.
